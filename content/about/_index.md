I have 7+ years of experience in research, with a strong technical slant. In my research, I've built software and infrastructure to collect experimental data from users; I have worked extensively on statistical analyses of these datasets. I have experience with writing software, designing experiments, building data pipelines, analyzing data, iterating on machine learning models, and explaining results to diverse audiences.

My PhD research measured the biased outcomes of machine-learning systems used in online advertising.
