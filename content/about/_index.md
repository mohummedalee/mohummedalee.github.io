Thanks for stopping by! My name is Ali, and I have 7+ years of experience in research and engineering.

#### Work

At **Amazon**, I build data science tools to help [internal auditors](https://amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/fgbs/internal-audit) measure risk across Amazon's diverse businesses. At **Apple**, I built datasets and ran evaluations to test upcoming AI/ML features for safety. At **Oracle Labs**, I worked with the [ML Research Group](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=94065:12:11060783655161:7) on measuring gender and racial biases in BERT as a function of the model's scale and pre-training data ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21058)). At **Intel**, I worked with AI and Analytics team to build the early version of an automated model card generator, and experimented with explainability methods for models on image and tabular data---the team later turned this work into a fantastic open souce Python [toolkit](https://github.com/intel/intel-xai-tools).

#### Research

My [PhD research](/papers/phd-thesis-mali.pdf) measured the biased outcomes of machine learning systems used in online advertising. I studied Facebook's advertising platform to uncover gender and racial biases in the delivery of [job and housing ads](/papers/disc-through-opt.pdf); disparate pricing in the delivery of [political ads](/papers/ali-2021-wsdm.pdf); age and gender biases in the delivery of [clickbait and deceptive ads](/papers/usenixsecurity23-ali.pdf).

<!-- To measure these effects, I designed experiments, built data collection pipelines, and ran statistical analyses on data. -->

This work was widely covered in the media ([Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wVPyiyukQc), [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613274/facebook-algorithm-discriminates-ai-bias/), [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-ad-system-discrimination/)), and I had the opportunity to brief staff at the U.S. House of Representatives about our results. Meta later agreed to fix racial biases in their housing ad delivery as part of a [settlement](https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-ad-system-discrimination/) with the U.S. Department of Justice.

#### Personal

I live in Seattle, WA, with my wife and daugther. Previously, I've lived in Boston/Cambridge, MA---where I was a part of [Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu). In the more distant past, I lived in Saarbrücken, Germany---where I was a student at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), and a research assistant at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://mpi-sws.org/). I am originally from [Lahore, Pakistan](https://youtu.be/N7kvo94PKN4?t=126). I am bilingual in Punjabi and Urdu, and speak just enough German to order a döner kebab. I enjoy reading, single player video games, tabla, and film photography.

<!-- Back in Lahore, I used to be a backend engineer at a small music startup called [Patari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patari_(service)). -->

<!-- #### Tools
Across these roles, I've used a variety of tools, including scientific Python---TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, HuggingFace, scikit-learn, matplotlib, networkx etc.

frequently used tools like , Docker, AWS, SQL, among many others.
**Tools** I used in this work frequently involved Python (, PyTorch, HuggingFace, networkx), JavaScript, SQL, R, Spark, and others. -->
