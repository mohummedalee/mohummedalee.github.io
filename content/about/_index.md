![a headshot](/charles-cropped.jpg) I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science at [Northeastern University](https://khoury.northeastern.edu), advised by [Alan Mislove](https://mislove.org). My [dissertation](/papers/phd-thesis-mali.pdf) used algorithm auditing to measure failures such as job discrimination, political filter bubbles, and disparaties in exposure to clickbait due to Facebook's ad personalization algorithms. My work was recognized with an [Outstanding Graduate Student](https://provost.northeastern.edu/academic-honors/graduate-awards/graduate-research-awards/) award.
